# Numerical Differentiation

Numerical differentiation is perhaps the most obvious approach to finding a function's gradient (that is, differentiating it) if you're a programmer.

The gradient is just a fancy name for the slope


To find the gradient of a function `f` at a point `x` using numerical differentiation we can:

1. Calculate
